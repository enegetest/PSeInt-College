# PSeInt-College
 PSeInt-College" is my educational journey into the world of PSeInt programming for my second semester at PUCMM. where I explore algorithmic thinking and problem-solving.

## Project Goals

- Explore programming concepts through Pseint.
- Document my learning journey and track progress.
- Grasp the concepts of algorithmic thinking and problem-solving
- Develop a better approach to solving computer science problems through problem statements. (because I'm bad at it)

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `aside_pseint/`: My independent PSeInt learning journey.
- `pucmm_pseint/`: College-related PSeInt coursework.
- `docs_pseint/`: Study resources or notes related to the learning process.
